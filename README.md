# telstra-java-challenge

## Scenario 

Using the sample data “cars.zip” create a simple, resuable Java library that: 

 
- pre-loads the give data records 
- allows new data records to be added 
- allows data to be retrieved by registration  
- allows data to be retrieved to a combination of make/model/year (all 3 mandatory) (Add this data yourself)

## Requirements 

- Use only core-Java – no imported libraries 
- Assume that your library will be used within a server environment 
- Consider that the dataset could grow very large (for the sake of this exercise you can assume that memory is unlimited) 
- Use code comments to explain your design decisions 
- Ensure appropriate best practices are employed  
- Clone this repository then upload your work to your own github, providing the HR team with a link
